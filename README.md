# Invoice-Analysis
Invoice Analysis script will graph the results of a large number of invoices for a client I worked with (No actual data is uploaded here)

The client needed a solution to automate the production of a graph. 
This graph needed to take monthly .xlsx summary files and extract key info about payments and account status (past due, current, etc.).
Then, that data was used to graph the account status rates for each months over the last 4-5 years.
